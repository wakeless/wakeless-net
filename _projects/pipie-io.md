Pipie.io is a GitLab and Slack integration that speeds up the interactions that engineers have when collaborating and coordinating between themselves, GitLab merge requests, pipelines and Slack.

The platform streamlines engineering workflows by providing seamless communication between GitLab's development tools and Slack's messaging platform, enabling teams to stay informed about merge request updates, pipeline status changes, and deployment notifications without leaving their preferred communication environment.
